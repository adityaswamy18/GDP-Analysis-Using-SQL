#  Global Data Analysis Using SQL

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis on global datasets including GDP, Population, Emission, Energy Consumption, and Production.

## Project Objective
To derive actionable insights about:
- Global emissions
- Energy production & consumption
- GDP and population trends
- Environmental sustainability

##  Datasets Used (6 Tables)
- `country_3.csv` – Country codes and names  
- `population_3.csv` – Population data by year and country  
- `gdp_3.csv` – GDP data by year and country  
- `emission_3.csv` – Emissions data by year and country  
- `production_3.csv` – Energy production (renewable/non-renewable)  
- `consum_3.csv` – Energy consumption by source  

##  Features Implemented
- SQL Views, CTEs, and Joins  
- Stored Procedures for reusable queries  

##  KPI Metrics
- Top 5 Green Countries  
- Emission per Capita  
- Energy Intensity (GDP per unit energy)  

##  Correlation Analysis
- GDP Growth vs Energy Production Growth  

##  Insightful Aggregations
- Global average GDP, Emission, and Population by year  
- Global emission share by country  
- Top 10 populous countries and their emissions
